## Train Tickets (React)

This is a train/metro tickets purchase app for a (mocked) metro line. The user can select departure/destination stations and a date. After purchase the app will show a ticket with the route, price calculated by distance between stations and a QR code to enter the station. Additionally there is a responsive map of the route.

Showcasing: form handling and validation, Math functions, state management, context usage, QR codes and dynamic styling with Tailwind CSS.
